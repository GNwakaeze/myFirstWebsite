        <p>This is my webpage, soon to be a full website, here I will document things about me and my journey into <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com">coding</a></p>
        <p>The first thing you need to know is that I dont intend for anyone to ever actually read this (<i>I mean, who wants to pay attention to a random site of a learner? weirdo</i>), so I will type as fast as I can and I will not correct any typos. I will also not use any punctuation unless i do it form muscle memory. this is all abotu look and feel and getting enough words on the page to do things with and make it look like a really real website. After this, my plan is to help my sister lainch her webpage for her designs and maybe someday I'll make a lot of cash DOY-LAR by doing this professionally</p>

        <h2>A bit about me:</h2>
            <p>I have been thinking about learnng to code for a while. since April 2020 to be exact. So here's how it all began... </p>
            <p>I went to the university of Bedforshire form 2011 - 2014. I studied pyschology and criminal behaviour. at uni, i met a few new friends and also had a load of old friends from college and from secondary school. this story starts with some friends from college. at uni they made some new friends, one beign Yasmin Taylor. I remember going to meet Sid and Nicola at their freidns place Asma, (or was it Roxannes Place? I think it was Roxys palce) anyway, we were chilling and drinking amd talking and that when i met Yas. she was really pretyy, like natually pretyy and quite shy too. now heres something ou need to knwo about my college friends, we aint shy! this poor yas was falling into the background, so i decided to pull her out. "yas, tell us a bit about yourself, what are you studying?" she said artificial intelligence and robotics. i didnt even know that was a course! she went into a little more detail about it na dthat was that. i diont remember seeing her more than a couple of times, but we added each other on facebook, then at some point she migrated over to my instagram too. and that's where she stayed until 2020</p>  
            <p>While on Twitter, I noticed a lot of people tweeting about some girl who posted that she made a 6-figure salary. Some people didint believe her and others did, me? I didnt give a fuck, good for her. i made a bunch of assumptions that she was probably rich alread, or found a niche in the market or was trying to sell me something so that she could make more money. no thanks pyramid scheme! so i carried on scrolling and didnt think anything of it.</p>
            <P>Then a few weeks later,Twitter was abuzz again about this same girl. The general point was that poeple had done her dirty. they had abused her until she closed her account and aparently they had gone as far as contacting her employers to try and verify her salary. I though that was CRAY! I tried to find the girls account to see what she said that angered people, but all i could see was her twitter @TailaSky and it looked familiar (because it was the same as her insta which i hadnt paid attention to)  but i just couldnt place it. <em> maybe shes been retweeted onto my page or something</em> I thought.</P>
            <p>Fast forward a few more weeks and there i am scrolling through facebook and Taylor posts a pretty long post. now heres the thing about long possts, they usually tell a pretty interesting story, bne it sad, happy or a juicy rant to goss over. but there i was reading her piost and she was ranting. she was pissed that she tried to share her knowledge with the world and that they abused her and contacted her employers. then BING! the link was made. OMG, she's the girl! I cant believe this, I kow the girl! and yes, the handle was so familioar because I see her on IG all the freaking time! I know the girl! </p>
            <p> So i inboxed her to let her know that i was totally in support of her and I'd read about the awful things and i was sorry that it happened. she didnt respond..... But, she did post on IG a few days after saying that she was thankful for the supportive message and reposted her orginal post. This time I paid attention</p>
        
        <h3>My first enounter with coding</h3>
            <p>I clicked on the link for Yasmins post and it was a video and she went over her background about doing AI in uni and how that lead to her current career in Dev OPs. She sahared that there were nbot a lot of women in the field and it was a great career to get into. I read up on Dev Ops and thought to myself. this is way too technical for me. I just learnt how to do a CountIf on excel, I'll never be able to master code. Every time she posted though, I paid attention. </p>
            <p><strong>Then in April 2021</strong>, I had a friend who decided to learn coding. We lost touch, so, i dont know how far along in their journey they are now, but it put it fresh in my mind.</p>
            <p>So, in October 2021, when I met a programmer, I was primed and ready to understand more about what he did. he showed me how to open up a terminal and he showed me around using a command line. This is bascially a back door that looks at folders and documents.</p>
            <p>In December 2021, i took the plunge. I went online and read a few articles, which lead me to a few videos, which lead me to The Odin Project</p>
        
        <h4>The Odin Project</h4>
            <p>There's not much to say here other that its been pretty good. I learnt to make this page through it, and i hope to learn so much more. I hope to document it all through more web pages, then make my sisters site, then make me some mooooooolaaaah</p>
